# Happy Thoughts

This project's goals is to learn about a React component's lifecycle and how to react to that. How to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect. I worked with a Happy Thoughts API which showcases previously posted thoughts, gives us the possibility to post new thoughts and also give likes to the already existing ones.
