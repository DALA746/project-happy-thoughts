# Happy Thoughts

This project's goals is to learn about a React component's lifecycle and how to react to that. We looked at how to react to changes in state or a component mounting using useEffect. We worked with a Happy Thoughts API which showcases previously posted thoughts, gives us the possibility to post new thoughts and also give likes to the already existing ones ðŸ’Œ

Update:
I have now created my own Happy Thoughts API to use for this project: it's an Express API using MongoDB Atlas and deployed to Heroku âœŒ

# What I learned

- What component lifecycle means.
- How to use theÂ `useEffect`Â hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
- How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
